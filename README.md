# [WIP] DLIOM - Direct Lidar-Intertial Odometry: Perceptive and Connective SLAM

This repo implements [DLIOM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01843), based on DLIO [[repo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03749)] | [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03749)]

## Current Status

### Frontend

* [ ] 2-step deskew
* [ ] Jaccard-based keyframing
* [ ] Slip-resistant keyframing

### Backend

* [ ] GPS factor
* [ ] Sequential factor
* [ ] Jaccard similitarity constraint
* [ ] Gravity factor
